# Data Visualization App using Streamlit

This Python application is designed to provide interactive 3D data visualizations using Streamlit. It offers insightful visualizations for two distinct datasets: the Iris dataset and the MPG dataset.

## Features
The Iris dataset is a well-known dataset containing information about various species of iris flowers. The 3D plot below visualizes the relationship between sepal length, sepal width, and petal length, with different species represented by colors and petal width represented by marker size.
